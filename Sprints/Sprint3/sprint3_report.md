## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For this sprint, we focused on implementing four key features: a notifications system, editing pending reservations, usage analytics for admins, and viewing a user's rental. With these features completed, the main functionality of the system we planned is finished. Despite difficulty communicating with one teammate, the sprint went smoothly.
