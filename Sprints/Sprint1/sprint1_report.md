We setup the PostgreSQL database and populated it with sample data using SQL scripts.
Additionally, we build the Flask backend, connected it to PostgreSQL, and created
some API endpoints that need further testing.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user
stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward

acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the
issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate
it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so
that it can be addressed later.
